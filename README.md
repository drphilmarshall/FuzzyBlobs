# Fuzzy Blobs

Some exploration of Dave Sand's idea to try and find low SB satellite galaxies within 1Mpc, in the LSST reprocessed SDSS Stripe 82 imaging. Started at the AAS227 Hack day, this is research in progress, and really just an initial foray. If you are interested in this project, please do get in touch by asking a question or making a comment in [this repo's issues](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/FuzzyBlobs/issues). 

## Demo

The rough plan is to search the LSST DM stack-reprocessed SDSS Stripe 82 images for low surface brightness, large angular scale features by first masking out the detected objects, rebinning the masked images to some large pixel scale (10 arcsec?), and re-running an object detector on it. The images form part of the Summer 2013 data challenge. 

**IPython Notebook coming soon!**
